      "p1": "As you already might know, the Frontend chapter was rebooted in August, just like Spiderman movies. The (re)original team, led by the Javier \"The Man\" Leal includes NextJS superhero Iván Esteban, React guru Alexis Reina and the rising developer-superstar Andrea Calvo. The Marvel comparisons here are inevitable. The team has been working really hard to give the chapter a big push to recover from the failed start and be at the front-of-the line, where we all expect it to be.",
